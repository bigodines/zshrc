# ZSHRC

This is [Caius][]' ZSH configs for his shell. It has an `install` script to symlink the dotfiles into `$HOME`. Written specially for Caius, should be easy enough to modify but never question why, it's because it helps Caius do his work. :-)

## Installation

Should be simply:

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git://github.com/caius/zshrc.git .zsh
    $ ./.zsh/install
